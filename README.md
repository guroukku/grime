A utility for unpacking resource files (.RSF) for Grimoire: Heralds of the Winged Exemplar

##### What works:
Unpacks files from SuperDemo and Release RSFs according to header info.

##### What doesn't:
Many files are missing headers (e.g., *.BMP) or encoded in some fashion (e.g., *.TXT).<br>
Can't unpack RSF files from the DOS beta currently.
